# Welcome to the Kirrander Group!

This is the github organisation of the Kirrander research group at the University of Oxford, Department of Chemistry.

Ultrafast imaging, made possible by new light-sources such as X-ray free-electron lasers, and advances in theory and quantum simulations, stand to transform our understanding of ultrafast processes in atoms and molecules. Our group develops new theory for new experiments, making sure we make the most of these new opportunities.

More on the group's work can be found on [our website](https://kirrander.web.ox.ac.uk)
